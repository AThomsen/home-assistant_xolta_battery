# Xolta Solar Battery for Home Assistant

Unofficial and crude integration for Xolta Solar battery.

Uses the existing api of the web app as it seems no public api is available.

## Installation

Install using HACS. In a browser, log in to the offical Xolta app and snatch `site id` and `refresh token` using the browsers *Developer tool* (F12).
