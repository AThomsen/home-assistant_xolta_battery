# Xolta Solar Battery for Home Assistant

Unofficial integration for Xolta Solar battery.

Uses the existing api of the web app as it seems no public api is available.

## Installation

The integration requires a [helper-add-on](https://github.com/AThomsen/home-assistant_xolta_battery_authentication-addon) that takes care of getting an API access token from a username and password. Install this first. Make sure to enable *Start at boot*.

Then Install integration using HACS: HACS -> Integrations -> (kebab menu) -> Custom repositories -> Repsitory `https://github.com/AThomsen/home-assistant_xolta_battery` Category: Integration.
